### Why Aegis?

#### Software could be the next shield for our home 🛡️

In mid-2022, we did a job research from overseas 
Taiwanese developer and designer Facebook groups. 
We got <Text as='span' mx='1' fontSize='2xl' color='red'>271</Text> replies 
working in the USA, EU, Japan, Singapore, Israel, etc. 

Up to <Text as='span' mx='1' fontSize='2xl' color='red'>63.3%</Text> 
of overseas Taiwanese employees (most of them in the software area) would return to 
Taiwan if there were a software/startup ecosystem like the countries they live in. Why can't they stay in their hometown? 
They also pointed out several key reasons:

1. lack of capital and investors (61.1%)
2. lack of oversea experiences (50%)
3. lack of government policy (48.9%)
4. lack of big exits and icons (47.8%)
5. <Text as='span' color='red'> lack of networking platforms (35.6%) 👈 </Text> 

Networking is hard. 

We need a dead simple site to let people communicate.
By leveraging ideas from HackerNews and AngelList, we build Aegis to Taiwanese people.
It would not be another media site or LinkedIn alternative.
All time open sourced, free and no advertisement. 

* You can find out startup/dev/design news 📰  
* You can find out great talents 🧑‍💻   
* You can find out founders 👫
* You can find out investors 👨‍🦳

The vision is that we could gel Taiwaneses energy worldwide just like Jewish did. 

#### All about Taiwanese startups and the software ecosystem 👊
