### Why Aegis?

#### We care Taiwan and believe software could be the next shield just like semiconductor industry since decades ago. 🇹🇼 

In mid-2022, we did job research from overseas 
Taiwanese engineer and designer Facebook groups. 
We got <Text as='span' fontSize='lg'>271</Text> replies 
working in the USA, EU, Japan, Singapore, Israel, etc. 

<Text as='span' color='red' fontSize='lg'>63.3%</Text> 
of overseas Taiwanese employees (most of them in the software area) would return to 
Taiwan if there were a software/startup ecosystem like the countries they live in. Why they can't stay? 
They also pointed out several key reasons:

1. lack of capital and investors (61.1%)
2. lack of oversea experiences (50%)
3. lack of government policy (48.9%)
4. lack of big exits and icons (47.8%)
5. <Text as='span' color='red' fontSize='lg'> lack of networking platforms (35.6%) 👈 </Text> 

So we build a community to solve the networking
problem. It is not another media site or LinkedIn alternative.
All time open source, free and no advertisement. 

* You can find out startup/dev/design news 👀   
* You can find out great talents 🧑‍💻   
* You can find out founders 👫
* You can find out investors 👨‍🦳

The vision is that we could integrate Taiwaneses' energy worldwide just like Jewish did. 

#### All about Taiwanese startups and the software ecosystem 👊
